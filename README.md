## Additional Information ‚ÑπÔ∏è

### Logging
The application uses Java's built-in logging framework. Logs are configured via the `application.properties` file and are automatically saved during runtime.

### Security
The application uses **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for authentication. Ensure that you set the `JWT_SECRET` environment variable in your `.env` file to securely sign JWT tokens.

### Database
The application requires a **MySQL database**. Ensure the following variables are configured correctly:

- `DATABASE_URL`
- `DATABASE_USERNAME`
- `DATABASE_PASSWORD`

You can import preconfigured schema and tables if needed. (Provide a schema file if applicable.)
